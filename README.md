## Effects of Public Debt on Equity Prices

With the growing debt harbored by the United States becoming harder to sustain, I believe it is important to supplement the literature surrounding the country’s public debt and 
its effects on our financial system. This study considers the rationality of the market, as it is influenced by this exogenous variable over time, and how that relates to an equity’s 
price movements. Utilizing the multiple linear regression model, which is estimated with OLS, paired with a time series analysis of monthly stock prices. I will determine how events 
related to public debt have an effect on equities. Furthermore, based on my analysis it can be determined that changes related to the public debt can leave a small marginal effect on stock prices in the short term.
